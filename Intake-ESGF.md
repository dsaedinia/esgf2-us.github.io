## Overview

`intake-esgf` is a Python package that allows you to programmatically access ESGF data. It provides a flexible way to search, browse, and download Earth system model datasets directly from your code.

It is an [intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm) _inspired_ package under development by ESGF2. The main difference is that in place of querying a static index, which is completely loaded at runtime, `intake-esgf` catalogs initialize empty and are populated by searching, querying ESGF index nodes dynamically.
