## Overview

`intake-esgf` is an [intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm) _inspired_ package under development by ESGF2 that provides programmatic access to ESGF data holdings. The main difference is that in place of querying a static index, which is completely loaded at runtime, `intake-esgf` catalogs initialize empty and are populated by searching, querying ESGF index nodes dynamically.
