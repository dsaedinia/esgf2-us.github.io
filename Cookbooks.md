## Overview

A cookbook is essentially a “recipe book” of reusable, domain‑specific workflows implemented as Jupyter Notebooks.
The `ESGF Cookbook` focuses on highlighting analysis recipes, as well as data acccess methods, all accesible within the Python programming language. This cookbook also spans beyond the scope of a single Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ex. CMIP6), expanding to other experiments/datasets such as CMIP5 and obs4MIPs. <br>To access the `ESGF Cookbook` click&nbsp;[here](https://projectpythia.org/esgf-cookbook/).
