# Introduction

`esgpull` is a modern ESGF data management tool, bundled with a custom asynchronous interface with the [ESGF Search API].
It handles scanning, downloading and updating **datasets**, **files** and *queries* from ESGF.

<!-- Its simple data model makes `esgpull` easy to use, it is completely possible to never download a single file and still find a use for it. -->

## Feature highlight

- Simple syntax for fast data exploration
- Asynchronous download
- Highly configurable
- Plugin system for extensibility

## Setup

Run `$ pip install esgpull` to install the latest release and its dependencies.

Have a look at the [Installation page](installation) for more ways to install.
