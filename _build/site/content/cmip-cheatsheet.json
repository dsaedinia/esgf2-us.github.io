Since 1995, CMIP has been coordinating this model intercomparison across the climate science community.","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"key":"YPKUBvVx6h"}],"key":"fWJnQSc76E"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This multi-model approach helps to evaluate climate models, leads to improvements in the model simulations and provides a better understanding of past, present and future climates.
