# Metagrid Guide

## What is Metagrid?

[Metagrid](https://aims2.llnl.gov/) is the next-generation search interface for the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). It's a user-friendly web application designed to help researchers find and access climate model data stored within the ESGF. Think of it as a more advanced way to search for and retrieve the data needed for climate research. You can access Metagrid [here](https://aims2.llnl.gov/).

## MetaGrid's Function:

MetaGrid is the tool that users interact with to search through the vast amount of data available through ESGF. It offers features like:

1. Facet Value Free-Text Entry: Allows users to quickly find relevant options by typing instead of scrolling through long lists of facets (like model names, variables, etc.).

2. Saved Searches: Users can save their search queries and reuse them later.
   Shareable Result Links: Enables users to share specific search results with colleagues.

3. How it helps:
   MetaGrid simplifies the process of finding the specific climate data needed for research, making it easier to access and utilize the data available through ESGF.
